## ðŸ§  Introduction

Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by brain atrophy and neuronal death due to abnormal protein accumulation. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes.

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify MRI scans into one of four stages of Alzheimerâ€™s:

* **NonDemented**
* **VeryMildDemented**
* **MildDemented**
* **ModerateDemented**

The proposed custom baseline CNN model has been trained on **10,114 grayscale MRI images**, achieving a remarkable **97.80% accuracy**, outperforming traditional machine learning methods and some advanced pre-trained models like **Xception**.
